# Special Thanks
Huge thanks to [hiimjasmine00](https://github.com/hiimjasmine00) for adding macOS support!

# Note about macOS and iOS
Because I don't own any Apple devices, there may be a couple of bugs when using macOS or iOS
If there are any issues, please report them on GitHub, or contact me on Discord @BobbyShmurner, and I'll do my best to fix them :)

# Known Bugs
If your mouse supports horizontal scrolling, Geometry Dash will register it as a scroll up.
This sometimes causes you to zoom in accidently while panning around with the middle mouse.
There isn't a simple immediate fix for this, so for now I'm just gonna leave it as it is :D
